# Introduction to Mobile Robotics and Robot Operating System (ROS)

## Course Description
The course will consider the algorithms that form the basis of modern mobile robots: localization algorithms (Kalman filter, particle filter), path planning (A* algorithm and its modifications, Rapidly-exploring random tree, Dynamic Window approach and others), control algorithms (PID-controller, trajectory follower). The kinematic schemes of various types of wheeled robots and proba- bilistic observation models of common sensors (cameras, ultrasonic sensors, LI- DARs) will also be considered. Practical part of the course will include hands-on experience with popular software framework for robots â€“ Robot Operating Sys- tem (ROS). The course will cover the basic terms and concepts of programming using ROS, as well as the tools included in ROS for visualization, simulation, and debugging of various aspects of robotics software. As part of team projects and homework assignments, we will implement navigation and control algorithms and test them on simulations of robots that are part of ROS.
